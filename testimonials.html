                    <p>"I’ve been using Planta for just over 4 months now as a premium user and I love it. It helps me keep my plants organized and healthy. While I am a relatively new plant “parent”, and I rely on it to help me know when to water, fertilize, and generally care for all of my plants (35!), I know that I still have to trust my own instincts and that every plant is different."</p>

                    <p>"I just started using this app since I’ve gotten into house plants. I love how detailed descriptions are and all plants come with care and maintenance information. I love that there’s a snooze button for watering schedules, and that they are tailored to the season, type of room, type of pot that your plant is in for the most accurate watering needs."</p>

                    <p>"I never ever leave reviews but wow this app is worth the time!! Full proof for me with its notifications I never miss a beat with plant care, I’m a space cadet and have a history of killing many plants, but this has completely turned that around for me!"</p>
